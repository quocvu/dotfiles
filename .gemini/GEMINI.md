## Rules

- Before trying to update a file, always read it first to ensure you have the correct content.

## Rules when coding with Python

*    Avoid using `**kwargs` to pass params to functions.  It makes the code hard to read.
*    Use type hints for all class attributes, class methods, and functions.
*    When calling functions, used named parameters as much as possible
